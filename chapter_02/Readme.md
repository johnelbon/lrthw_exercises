Code changes:
Modified double quotes to single quotes to make Rubocop happy.

> Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

I was right, it comments out code. I will call # the pound character.

> Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backwards. Start at the last line and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.

Done.

> Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

No, I did not find any mistakes.

> Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

Nope, I did not find any more mistakes.

> Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code?

Cmnd-/ will comment out the line the cursor is currently on,
if you want to comment out a bunch of lines, highlight them,
then hit Cmnd-/.
